=================

My programs written as solutions to the challenges of the 4th edition of The Tuenti Challenge

Index
-------------------------------

**Challenge 1 - Anonymous Poll** 		Bash: c1.sh  
**Challenge 2 - F1 - Bird's-eye Circuit** 	PHP/Bash: c2.php c2.sh  
	Notes: I implemented the Bash version using ANSI escape characters to move the cursor on a terminal, which of course does not validate. But I wanted to keep it anyway. For the love of Bash ^^.  
**Challenge 3 - The Gambler's Club - Monkey Island 2** PHP: c3.php  
**Challenge 4 - Shape shifters** 		PHP: c4.php  
**Challenge 5 - Tribblemaker** 			PHP: c5.php  
**Challenge 6 - Man in the middle** 		Node.js: c6.js  
**Challenge 7 - Yes we scan** 			Bash: c7.sh  
**Challenge 9 - Bendito Caos** 			PHP: c9.php  
**Challenge 10 - Random Password** 		PHP: c10.php  
**Challenge 11 - Pheasant** 			PHP: c11.php  
**Challenge 13 - Tuenti Timing Auth** 		PHP: c13.php  
**Challenge 14 - Train Empire** 		PHP: c14.php  
	Notes: Quasi-correct version of the challenge but not perfectly efficient.  
**Challenge 16 - ÑAPA** 			Bash/PHP: c16.php  
	Notes: I implemented a correct version of it, but VERY slow for the test inputs :S  
	
How to run
-------------------------------
I included the 2013-1 tools for UNIX/MAC provided at the official page at https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools
Clone and execute each challenge like:  
`./test_challenge TOKEN php c4/c4.php` or `./test_challenge TOKEN c1/c1.sh`  
Be sure to set execute permissions for the Bash scripts.

Disclaimer
-------------------------------
I uploaded the scripts AS IS. Maybe something is broken, and maybe some of then are incorrect.  
This was my first Tuenti Challenge. Ended on ranking 43.
